# Card

## Introduction

Card are graphical elements that show visual form representing a card with header

## Basic Usage

Firstly, you have to import `Card` atom so that you can start to use it

```
	import { Card } from "@atoms/Card";
	or
	import { Card } from "@atoms/index";
	<Card />
```

## Card with some texts and custom background color, boxShadow, and borderRadius

Card can be customized in using the 'bg | p | borderRadius | boxShadow' prop, which accepts four different options. This allows you to easily adjust to suit your needs.

```
    <Card bg="white" p={4} borderRadius={4} boxShadow="lg">
      <h2>Card title</h2>
      <p>Some card content goes here</p>
    </Card>
```

<x.div display="inline-flex" gap={6}>
  <Card bg="white" p={4} borderRadius={4} boxShadow="lg">
    <h2>Card title</h2>
    <p>Some card content goes here</p>
  </Card>
</x.div>

## A card with an image and some text content:

Card can contain an image and texts

```
<Card>
    <img src="https://placeimg.com/640/480/animals" alt="Cute animal" />
    <p>This is a card with an image</p>
    <p>It also has some text content</p>
</Card>
```

<Card>
  <img src="https://placeimg.com/640/480/animals" alt="Cute animal" />
