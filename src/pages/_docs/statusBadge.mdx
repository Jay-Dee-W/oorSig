# StatusBadge

## Introduction

The StatusBadge component can act as a label in applications by utilizing the isActive prop, which is a boolean prop. When the isActive prop is set to true, the StatusBadge is rendered with a checkmark label indicating privileged or admin status. When the isActive prop is set to false (which is the default), the StatusBadge has the dismiss mark label appearance.

## Basic Usage

Firstly, you have to import `StatusBadge` atom so that you can start to use it

```
	import { StatusBadge } from "@atoms/StatusBadge";

	or

	import { StatusBadge } from "@atoms/index";

	<StatusBadge/>
	<StatusBadge isActive={true} />

```

<StatusBadge />
<StatusBadge isActive={true} />

## Sizes

StatusBadges can be customized in size using the 'size' prop, which accepts five different options: `'xs', 'sm', 'md', 'lg', and 'xl'`, and the default size is `'md'`. This allows you to easily adjust the size of the StatusBadge to suit your needs.

```
	<StatusBadge  size='xs' />
    <StatusBadge  size='md' />
    <StatusBadge  size='lg' />
    <StatusBadge  size='xl' />
    <StatusBadge  size='sm' />

	<StatusBadge  size='xs' isActive={true}/>
    <StatusBadge  size='sm' isActive={true}/>
    <StatusBadge  size='md' isActive={true}/>
    <StatusBadge  size='lg' isActive={true}/>
    <StatusBadge  size='xl' isActive={true}/>
```

<x.div>
  <StatusBadge size="xs" />
  <StatusBadge size="sm" />
  <StatusBadge size="md" />
  <StatusBadge size="lg" />
  <StatusBadge size="xl" />
</x.div>
<x.div>
  <StatusBadge size="xs" isActive={true} />
  <StatusBadge size="sm" isActive={true} />
  <StatusBadge size="md" isActive={true} />
  <StatusBadge size="lg" isActive={true} />
  <StatusBadge size="xl" isActive={true} />
</x.div>

## systemProps

In addition to the size prop, you can further customize statusBadge by passing system props. These additional props provide more flexibility in styling.
