# StatusBadge

## Introduction

Spinners are graphical elements that show the progress or status of a process, commonly used to indicate an unspecified wait time or display ongoing tasks.

## Basic Usage

Firstly, you have to import `Spinner` atom so that you can start to use it

```
	import { StatusBadge } from "@atoms/StatusBadge";

	or

	import { StatusBadge } from "@atoms/index";

	<StatusBadge/>
```

## Sizes

Spinners can be customized in size using the 'size' prop, which accepts five different options: `'xs', 'sm', 'md', 'lg', and 'xl'` and the default size is `md`. This allows you to easily adjust the size of the spinner to suit your needs.

```
	<StatusBadge  size='xl' />
	<StatusBadge  size='md' />
	<StatusBadge  size='xs' />
	<StatusBadge  size='lg' />
	<StatusBadge  size='sm' />
```

<x.div display="inline-flex" gap={6}>
	<StatusBadge  size='xl' />
	<StatusBadge  size='md' />
	<StatusBadge  size='xs' />
	<StatusBadge  size='lg' />
	<StatusBadge  size='sm' />
</x.div>

## systemProps

In addition to the size prop, you can further customize spinners by passing system props such as borderColor , border and other as props. These additional props provide more flexibility in styling, with the default borderColor being set to white.
