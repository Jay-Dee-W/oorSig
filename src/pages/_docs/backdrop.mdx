# Backdrop

## Introduction

The `Backdrop` component is a reusable UI element used to create a semi-transparent overlay behind other elements, often to highlight modals or other dialogs.

## Basic Usage

To use the `Backdrop` component, you need to import it as follows:

```jsx
import { Backdrop } from '@atoms/Backdrop';
import { Backdrop } from '@atoms/index';
```

## Inside your JSX code, you can use the `Backdrop` component like this:

```jsx
<Backdrop onClick={handleBackdropClick} />
```

## Props

The Backdrop component accepts the following props:

`onClick (optional):` A function to be called when the backdrop is clicked. This prop is commonly used to handle dismissing modals or other overlays when the backdrop is clicked.

### SystemProps

In addition to the other props, you can further customize backdrop by passing system props. These additional props provide more flexibility in styling.

## Additional Props

The Backdrop component also accepts any additional props that can be applied to a div element, such as className, style, aria-\* attributes, and more.
