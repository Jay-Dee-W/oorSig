# Logo

## Introduction

The Logo Atom is a visually appealing and minimalist logo design that represents the core essence of your application in a simple and memorable way.

## Basic Usage

Firstly, you have to import `Logo` atom so that you can start to use it

```
	import { Logo } from "@atoms/Logo";

	or

	import { Logo } from "@atoms/index";

	<Logo/>
```

    <Logo/>

## Sizes

Logo can be customized in size using the 'size' prop, which accepts four different options: `'xs', 'sm', 'md', and 'lg'` and the default size is `md`. This allows you to easily adjust the size of the logo to suit your needs.

```
	<Logo size="xs" />
  	<Logo size="sm" />
  	<Logo size="md" />
  	<Logo size="lg" />
```

<x.div display=" inline-flex" gap={16}>
  <Logo size="xs" />
  <Logo size="sm" />
  <Logo size="md" />
  <Logo size="lg" />
</x.div>

## systemProps

In addition to the size prop, you can further customize logo by passing system props. These additional props provide more flexibility in styling.
