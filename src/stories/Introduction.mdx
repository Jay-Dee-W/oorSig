# Welcome to OORSIG Storybook

Storybook helps you build UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context.
That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states. Save these UI states as **stories** to revisit during development, testing, or QA.

In our repo, we use Storybook to develop and showcase our UI components. We have a separate Storybook directory that contains all of our UI components. For every new component or update to an existing one, we create a story for it in Storybook. A story is a visual representation of a component with its different states and props.

By using Storybook, new developers can quickly understand our components and how they work. They can use Storybook to view and test components in isolation, helping them understand how to use them and what props they accept. Storybook also enables developers to develop and test new components quickly and efficiently. They can create and test new components without running the entire application, speeding up the development process and ensuring components work correctly before integration. Overall, Storybook is a valuable tool that helps us develop and showcase our UI components efficiently.

all components must be in in `atoms` folder and they story should be in `stories`. to run storybook you have to install dependancies

Browse example stories now by navigating to them in the sidebar.
View their code in the `stories` directory to learn how they work.
We recommend building UIs with a [**component-driven**](https://componentdriven.org) process starting with atomic components and ending with pages.
